"""The position tracker — the deferred half of the buy/sell-alert request.

Son records his REAL Kalshi positions here; every live cycle prices each
one's hold-to-settlement EV against its cash-out-now value (both fee-aware)
and pushes an EXIT/HOLD read the moment the comparison flips. Alerts ride
the same fan-out as the signals (Discord + ntfy), so nothing depends on a
page being open.

Honesty contract (revised Jul 21): cash-out value is computed at the
polled YES BID minus the taker fee — the price an exit actually realizes.
When no bid is quoted the position is NOT EXECUTABLE: the verdict is
NO_BID (hold-side EV still shown) and no EXIT can fire. The ask is never
silently substituted. The HOLD side has no bias: settlement pays $1 per
contract, entry costs are sunk.
