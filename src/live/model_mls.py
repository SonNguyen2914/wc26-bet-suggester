"""mls-2026-v0 — the first MLS model (launch decision O8).

An interpretable goals-rate baseline run through the SHARED Monte Carlo
engine, with every parameter fitted from MLS 2026 data held in the live
database — WC26 values are structure, never coefficients:

  - attack_i  = shrunk, recency-weighted (GF/game)_i relative to league
  - defence_i = shrunk, recency-weighted (GA/game)_i relative to league
  - league_base = the season's goals per team-game (fitted, not 1.30)
  - venue multipliers = fitted home/away scoring split (not WC-neutral)
  - set-piece term: NEUTRAL (threat == baseline -> centered adj == 0);
    per the decision, no set-piece adjustment without decomposed inputs
  - form neutral 0.5, fatigue 0 (no validated covariates yet — a zero
    is honest where data quality is weak)

Validation: rolling-origin walk-forward over the season's completed
fixtures (no future match ever informs an earlier rating), scored
against a league-average baseline. approved_for_shadow is EARNED by
beating that baseline, not assumed.
