        match from a known state, seeded with the current score.

        Answers "who wins from HERE?" instead of the pre-match "who wins
        from 0-0?". Every input is checkable state, not a guess:
          - Goal rates come from the same xG model, time-scaled by
            (90 - minutes_elapsed) / 90. A Poisson process is memoryless,
            so the remaining-interval rate scales linearly with time left.
          - The current score seeds every simulation; remaining sampled
            goals are added on top. Totals/BTTS/scorelines therefore
            reflect FINAL totals automatically (e.g. at 1-0, over_0_5 is
            exactly 1.0 and btts is exactly P(away scores in remainder)).
          - Red cards are KNOWN inputs (counts, 0-3 per side), not sampled
            risks. Coefficients are literature-sourced (Vecer et al. 2009,
            WC 2006 + Euro 2008 in-play data: carded side x~2/3, opponent
            x~5/4 — see RED_CARD_* constants); a second red applies the
            same multiplier again (multiplicative extrapolation).
          - `phase` selects the match segment: "auto" infers from the
            minute; "regulation" clamps to 0-90; "et" simulates the
            REMAINING extra time from the current score (minute 90-120)
            then 50/50 penalties; "pens" is the shootout itself (50/50).
            In ET/pens, regulation has already ended LEVEL, so 90-minute
            markets (winner/totals/scores) are settled facts, not
            simulations — only advancement is priced.

        v1 limitations (documented, deliberate):
          - Stoppage time is not modeled (regulation phase clamps at 90).
          - The knockout x0.85 goal damping is inherited from the
            pre-match model (known hand-tuned debt) for consistency.

        Returns the exact same shape as simulate(), plus a "live_state"
        block, so prob_for_outcome_key() works on either result unchanged.
