"""In-play BUY/SELL signals on WATCHED markets.

"Watch" is Son's declaration: I'm betting (or holding) this market. Once
the match is live, the self-running live read re-prices every open book
from the remaining-match simulation; when that live model probability
diverges from the market's own price beyond LIVE_SIGNAL_MIN_DIFF, this
module fires a signal:

  BUY  — live model prices YES above the market (model − market >= +thr):
         the position looks cheap right now, add/enter.
  SELL — live model prices YES below the market (model − market <= −thr):
         the market is paying more than the model thinks it's worth,
         exit/take profit.

A second scan covers EVERY open book, watched or not: EASY WIN — the live
model calls the outcome near-certain (>= LIVE_EASYWIN_MIN_PROB) while the
price still pays (<= LIVE_EASYWIN_MAX_PRICE) and hasn't fully caught up
(gap >= LIVE_EASYWIN_MIN_DIFF). Watched markets are excluded from that
scan — they already get the sharper BUY/SELL treatment above.

Anti-spam: a market re-fires only after LIVE_SIGNAL_COOLDOWN_SECONDS have
passed AND the read materially changed — the side flipped, or the
divergence strengthened by >= RESTRENGTHEN beyond the last fired value.

These are deliberate, narrow exceptions to the "live edge is informational
only" rule — explicit pings Son asked for, never a board-wide TAKE
resurrection. Model-only rows (Kalshi book closed) can't fire — there is
nothing to buy or sell.
